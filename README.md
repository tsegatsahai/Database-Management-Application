# Database-Management-Application

This database application was built using Visual Studio. I had access to Visual Studio by 
using the Remote Desktop application to connect to MTSU's shemp.cs.mtsu.edu. A cs (computer science) account is needed to access this server.

If there is no MTSU CS account, the Visual Studio IDE can be downloaded free of charge 
from this site: https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/downloads/

After the visual studios application is set up, one simply double-clicks on the 
solution file named *database.snl* to launch the program.

After the program is opened in visual studios, there is a green 'Start' button located on 
the top of the page. One simply clicks on that for the program to compile and execute.

A demo of this database application can be found on YouTube under this link:
